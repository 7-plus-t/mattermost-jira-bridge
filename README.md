# JIRA Webhook Bridge for Mattermost

This repository contains a Python Flask application that accepts webhooks from [JIRA
Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and forwards them to the specified
channel or channels in a [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) server via an incoming webhook.
You can configure the application to post to channels based on JIRA projects and issue type
as described below in the **Configuration** section.
 
 **Import Notes**:
 * This application has only been tested with JIRA Server 7.9.2. 
 * This application was written extremely quickly and could use additional work in the form of refactoring, the addition of error handling, and testing (including on different versions of JIRA). Please feel free to jump in and help with pull requests, issues, etc.
 * This application is an example of how to bridge JIRA webhooks to Mattermost and is not 
 meant to be used in a production environment.
